    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a bone. 
        It is normally grilled or fried. Steak can be diced, cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.</p>

    <p>Place the steaks on the grill and cook until golden brown and slightly charred, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the steaks over and continue to grill 3 to 5 minutes for medium-rare (an internal temperature of 135 degrees F), 5 to 7 minutes for medium (140 degrees F) or 8 to 10 minutes for medium-well (150 degrees F).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Rub the steak all over with a good lug of olive oil and a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Add the steak to a hot pan, then cook for 6 minutes for medium-rare, or to your liking, turning every minute</li>
        <li>Halve a garlic clove and rub it over the steak every time you turn it</li>
        <li>Rub the steak with a knob of butter â€“ the sweetness from the butter will make it taste divine!</li>
        <li>Or create a herb brush by tying woody herbs like thyme or rosemary to the handle of a wooden spoon and brush it over the steak every minute or so</li>
    </ol>
